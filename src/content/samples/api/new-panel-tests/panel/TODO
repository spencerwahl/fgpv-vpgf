TODO: 

June 4: 
-Error testing with test cases
-width and height Observables (screen resize)
-one off error with panel registry
-get panel to incrementally shrink to its min position when resize changes and width shrinks
-CSS access from API folder
-remember registry has 1+ --> 2 means two panels occupy that grid

Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-unnescessary casting
-Good commenting
-Good typescript headers
-Make a list of all test cases


Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
