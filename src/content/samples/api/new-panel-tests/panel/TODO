- Actual css file in src/content/styles/api/panel.css

TODO: 
-pesky toggle button (seems to magically work sometimes?)


- Documentation
- Scrap map grid --> keep for debugging purposes, ask at meeting
-Private methods
-Good commenting (add examples in)
-can't seem to get around force casing for jquery .height() and .width(). sometimes putting it in an if statement with !== undefined works
but otherwise doesn't
-delete alerts and console.logs
-structural changes to code
-toggle button isn't going to go well after width change

-circular click effect button

-WHY DOES HACKY TOGGLE CODE WORK?


DOUBLE CHECK:
-toggle button --> malfunctions on window resize, can refresh on position change
-console.log/alerts
-dangling code/comments
-restriction to inner shell
-alt text, black toggle with buttons

-bug where stretching the width past a certain point causes increase/decrease in width
-update demo docs with set width/height methods

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable
