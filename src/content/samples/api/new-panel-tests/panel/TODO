-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable


DOCUMENTATION: 
0. if you wanna push them over, you have to make your own github-pages link, and host them there
1. https://codeburst.io/generate-docs-and-host-it-with-jsdoc-and-github-pages-113b9dae9acb 
2. npm run apidoc
3. https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/fgpv-vpgf/pull/2717













-Add features: controls and contents (demonstrate the setters and getters)
-Explain that contents are just one PanelElem --> basically a string, HTML, JQuery<HTMLElement>
-Explain shortcuts and demo them (title, |, x, t)
-Distinguish between SVG and Text Btns (they are all uniform)
