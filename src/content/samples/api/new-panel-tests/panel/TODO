TODO (MEETING PLAN): 

June 7:
-availableSpaces min feat
-testing and test cases for all positioning related things 
-both in .js file AND in console
-static form of available spaces
-set map object, add to panel registry done in a really hacky way

June 8: 
-toggle button find way to actually hide that portion of panel
-is the PanelElem string, HTML, jQuery<HTMLElement> proper? 
-SVG buttons are properly done? 
-Btns bypass PanelElem constructor?
-testing and test cases for set content (setting PanelElems), panel controls, making different types of Btns, shortcuts
-on window resize "height changes" even though no actual change





-Error testing with test cases 
-CSS access from API folder
-documentation
-scrap map grid --> keep for debugging purposes, ask at meeting
-object.prototype for privates to hide in console

-make sure available spaces and min position work impeccably! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-Test cases from console
-unnescessary casting
-Good commenting (add examples in)
-Good typescript headers
-Make a list of all test cases
-JQuery/document.getElementByID calls
-return void


Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable


DOCUMENTATION: 
0. if you wanna push them over, you have to make your own github-pages link, and host them there
1. https://codeburst.io/generate-docs-and-host-it-with-jsdoc-and-github-pages-113b9dae9acb 
2. npm run apidoc
3. https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/fgpv-vpgf/pull/2717













-Add features: controls and contents (demonstrate the setters and getters)
-Explain that contents are just one PanelElem --> basically a string, HTML, JQuery<HTMLElement>
-Explain shortcuts and demo them (title, |, x, t)
-Distinguish between SVG and Text Btns (they are all uniform)
