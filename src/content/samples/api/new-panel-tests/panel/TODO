June 4: 
-Error testing with test cases
-CSS access from API folder
-toggle button find way to actually hide that portion of panel
-resize delay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-unnescessary casting
-Good commenting
-Good typescript headers
-Make a list of all test cases


Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable
