TODO (MEETING PLAN): 

June 7:
-availableSpaces min feat
-static form of available spaces
    -so user can call RZ.Panel.availableSpaces(2,3); --> static
    -can call lightyear.availableSpaces(); --> calculates based on position
    -if no position is set calculaes

June 8: 
-toggle button find way to actually hide that portion of panel
-on window resize "height changes" even though no actual change
-auto shrink seems to be working on map grid, however, delayed alert as well as space between panels
-CSS access from API folder
-object.prototype for privates to hide in console

-scrap map grid --> keep for debugging purposes, ask at meeting

-make sure available spaces and min position work impeccably! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-unnescessary casting
-Good commenting (add examples in)
-Good typescript headers
-JQuery/document.getElementByID calls
-return void


Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable
