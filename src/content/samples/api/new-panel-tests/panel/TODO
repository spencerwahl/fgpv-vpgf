-actual css file in src/content/styles/api/panel.css





TODO: 

-object.prototype for privates to hide in console
-documentation
-scrap map grid --> keep for debugging purposes, ask at meeting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-Good commenting (add examples in)
-can't seem to get around force casing for jquery .height() and .width(). sometimes putting it in an if statement with !== undefined works
but otherwise doesn't

Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable
