Last minute checks: 
-Private methods
-Test cases from console
-unnescessary casting
-Good commenting (add examples in)
-Good typescript headers
-Make a list of all test cases
-JQuery/document.getElementByID calls
-return void


Future features (?): 
-Remove coverable for now, don't worry about greying out
-Assume all panels are non-coverable and don't allow other panels to open on min positions
-registry's  1+ feature (example: 2 means two panels occupy that gridspace) to be set when panels become coverable
