# RAMP2 FGP Visualiser

## What's new 

### October 23, 2018
- Re-wrote the [plugin](/plugins/main) documentation
    - `Extensions` are no longer referenced, using `Plugin` instead.
    - Simplified the `intention` definition to be a type of `Plugin`.
- Merged all plugin documentation into one file.



#### HTTPS

RAMP supports deployments to https production environments. It's important to know that all urls in your configuration file (including any proxies, map printing services, and layer services) must also be https enabled as most browsers block [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content). If you'd like to host both http and https connections for the same page setup your configuration file for https (https mixed content loaded on http connections is allowed).

#### Testing https on localhost

You can locally test RAMP using https by running the `npm run serve -- --env.https`. Navigate to https://localhost:6001/samples/index-https.html. You'll receive a "Your connection is not private" message in chrome since the SSL certificate generated by `webpack-dev-server` is self-signed. For testing purposes this is fine - click on "Advanced" then "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)".
