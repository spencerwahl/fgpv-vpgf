# WCAG Compliance

RAMP2 is WCAG 2.0 "AA" Compliant. Since we have no control over the content outside of the RAMP2 viewer, it is important for the host page to maintain this WCAG compliance. Below is a list of host page responsibilities to maintain WCAG 2.0 "AA" Compliant.

### "Skip to Content" Link

> The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material that are repeated on multiple Web pages by skipping directly to the main content of the Web page. The first interactive item in the Web page is a link to the beginning of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the main content. This technique is most useful when a Web page has one main content area, rather than a set of content areas that are equally important, and when there are not multiple navigation sections on the page.

### Page Titled

> The intent is to help users find content and orient themselves within it by ensuring that each Web page has a descriptive title. Titles identify the current location without requiring users to read or interpret page content. When titles appear in site maps or lists of search results, users can more quickly identify the content they need. User agents make the title of the page easily available to the user for identifying the page. For instance, a user agent may display the page title in the window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.

### Site Map

> A site map is a Web page that provides links to different sections of the site. To make the site map available within the site, at a minimum every page that is listed in the site map contains a link to the site map.

> The site map serves several purposes.

> - It provides an overview of the entire site.
> - It helps users understand what the site contains and how the content is organized.
> - It offers an alternative to complex navigation bars that may be different at different parts of the site.
