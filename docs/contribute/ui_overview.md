For a more granular look into the components that make up the UI, please see our [[UI]] guide.

## AngularJS

[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org) is a client-side JavaScript library. You should get familiar with its core concepts, specifically useful:

- Know the different between a directive and a service
- Understanding two way data binding
- How to use its templating system
- Solid knowledge of Promises and the `$q` service (stay away from deferred!)
- How `$timeout` can solve many problems but should always be avoided

Have a look at the [tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index) if you're just getting started with this library.

## Material Design

We follow Google's [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) specification. Since we use the AngularJS framework, [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) makes this easy. It's both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification.

## Animations 

Animations are handled with [GSAP](http://greensock.com/gsap) - GreenSock Animation Platform.
> a suite of JavaScript tools for high-performance HTML5 animations that work in all major browsers.

## Styling

We use [SASS](sass-lang.com), _Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets_, which compile into ordinary CSS files during the build process. Our SASS files are organised based on [SMACSS](https://smacss.com) - Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS.

You can write and execute SASS code at [SassMeister](http://www.sassmeister.com/gist/509c889fb58e69ee1977cb66864759eb).
